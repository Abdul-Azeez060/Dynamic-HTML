This is the implementation of Dynamic html
We know that we have to reload an entire page to see if there is any change in the DOM, but with this we can get realtime dom,
all the changes from the database or the server is going to be updated in the dom. 
This was used before React, as the only div is going to be reloaded not the whole page when we get any data from the server.
